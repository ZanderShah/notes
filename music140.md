**Diane Warren** (1956-) *Songwriter*
- Most successful in Western pop .

# North American Pop
> 1945 (End of WWII 1939-1945)

End of the "Big Band" era which dominated since the mid 1930s (trumpets, saxophone, trombone)
- Primarily intended for dancing.

Example: 1944 "Sentimental Journey" (Brown / Homer / Green)
- Performed by Les Brown and his Band of Renown, ft. Doris Day
    - Doris Day will become a film / music star in the 1950s.
- Singers were just a part of the band.
- Since 1950s, there is an emphasis on vocals but this was not always the case.
- Smooth voice, you can hear the words clearly.
- Band leaders are "stars". Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey.
- Mysic industry divided into 3 categores:
    1. Pop: White, middle class, urban / northern US (where the money is).
    2. Race (Blues): Black, regardless of class or location.
    3. Hillbilly (Country): Lower / working class, primarily white / southern US.
        - Origins in poor, rural part of southern US but is migrating to urban areas (particularily in the south).

Example of Race Music: "Good Rockin' Tonight" (Roy Brown 1947)
- Performed by Whyonie Harris in 1948.
- Specifically Jump Blues.
- A lot of the same instruments seem as the big bands but smaller (trumpets, saxophone).
- Rougher / grunge voice, harder to understand, chest sound.

Example of Hillbilly Music: "Blue Moon of Kentucky" (Bill Monroe 1946, recorded in 1947)
- Specifically Blue Grass.
- Different instruments: guitar, fiddle, mandelin.
- Controlled but nasal sound.

The **products** of the music insdustry at this time are sheet music and recordings. Sheet music dominates recordings until the late 1920s. By the end of WWII, recording industry has come to dominate.

## Why a Music Industry?
- 1600s, you could steal pamphlets and make copies yourself to sell because there was no intellectual property.
- People complained to the Queen so you can now get sole rights to make copies (copyright).
- You would get payments from the stationers company (Queen) when people used your work (royalties).

We need copyright law - intellectual property.
- 1790s-1830s, Ammendments to the copyright laws to cover sheet music.
- The Victorial Ballad: (Queen Victoria).

Industrial Revolusion made it so that there was now a middle class. The new middle class wanted to show off their money. Ways to do this are to buy luxury items (piano) and have daughters pursue "leisure" activities.

**Parlour Songs**

> Themes: Loyalty, honesty, control, restraint (idealized romance).
- Piano accompaniment, showcase vocal control.
- Daughters would move up the social ladder by marrying.
- Control / restraint style originates from Victorian age.

Demand for newly composed songs led to an increased organization of the music industry. Music writers did not make a lot of money at this point.

## Tin Pan Alley

Parlour song: "After the Ball" (Charles K Harris 1892)
- Typical song but became very popular, sheet music sold over 5 mil copies (usually less than 100k).
- Music industry's first "hit song".

**Why 1892?**
> Rural to urban shift.

There cannot be a hit song if everyone lives in rural areas because it is too hard to spread the song. In the US, many people are migrating to the urban areas at this point in time (by the 1890s, over $\frac{1}{3}$ lives in cities).

Now everyone knows you can get rich from the music industry, most of them go to New York City in a place known as Tin Pan Alley (Manhattan).

> One story is that everyones piano was overlapping each other and it sounded like people were banging on tin pans

- At it's peak in teh 1920s, 1930s, 21600 publishers, 36000 composers.
- Develops an efficient way of creating music, **divisions of labour** (composer, lyricist, publisher, publicity, performers). Allows for quality control and efficiency.
- Lyric style is still the same as before, idealized romance. 
- Music is made to be aasy to play / sing. AABA musical form.
    - Specifies the melody.

Example: "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" (Arden / Harburg 1939)

There was no focus on singer at this time, more on songs. Popular songs were not linked to an artist. There is also no distinction based on age (e.g. people of all ages would like big bands).

# North American Slave Trade
> (1619 - (1863) 1865)

Example: "Work Song - Old Alabama" 1947
- There were no recordings of slave work songs, this one is a prison work song.
- Used to pass time / set pace / coordinate work.
- **Song Leader**: Worked with many small pieces of songs and put them together in real time.
    - Two lines, guess which one it will be. More interactive than just repeating the same song.

## African Retentions
1. Interest in percussion and distorted timbres.
    - Shows emotion and dedication.
2. Values in the Ecstatic and the Cathartic.
3. Use of **Riffs**: Small self-contained musical gesture that repeats, becoming the basis for a longer composition.
4. Use of *call and response*.
    - Energy flow.

## Post Slavery
> (1865 -)
- Institutionalized racism.
- Acceleration of rural-to-urban shift.
- New form of music appears during the late 1800s.
- Ragtime and Jazz.
    - Urban stypes, incorporated into popular music.
- Centers close to the Mississipi river.

## Country (Rural) Blues
> Blues is a broad term.
- Wandering musicians.
- Male vocalist, with acoustic guitar.
- Plaintive vocal sound (lament).
- Themes include: travel, economics, love.

### Musical Form
- 12 measure phrases. No other styles specified length.
- a-a-b lyric pattern.
- Call and response between guitar and voice.
- Early Blues performers made use of *floating pool of verse* (not formally writing out song).

Example: "Travellin' Blues" (Blind Willie McTell 1929)
- First blues recording in the 1920s.
- Closer to folk music because lacks *self-awareness*.

Example: "Sweet Home Chicago" (Robert Johnson November 1936)
- Defined standards for blues guitar. 
- Only made two sets of recordings (November 1936 / June 1937).
- Standardized performance, very different from Blind Willie McTell.
- First steps of African American Culture being a major influence.
