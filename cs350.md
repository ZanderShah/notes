An OS is a system that manages resources, creates execution environments, loads programs, and provides common services and utilities.

- Started as simple I/O libraries, batch processors.

## Three Views of an OS

1. **Application View**: What services does it provide?
2. **System View**: What problem does it solve?
3. **Implementation View**: How is it built?

### Application View

Provides an execution environment for running programs.

- Provides program with processor time and memory space that it needs.
- Provides interfaces through which program can use networks, storage, I/O devices, other system hardware components. We want to abstract hardware from application programs.
- Isolates running programs from another and prevents undesirable interactions.

### System View

- Manages hardware resources of a computer system including processors, memory, disks, network interfaces, I/O devices, etc.
- Allocates resources among running programs.
- Controls the sharing of resources among programs.

The OS itself also uses resources.

### Implementation View

- Concurrency arises naturally in an OS when it supports concurrent applications, because it must interact directly with the hardware.
- Hardware interactions impose timing constraints.

**Kernel**: Part of OS that responds to system calls, interrupts, and exceptions.

**Operating System**: OS as a while includes the kernel, and may include other related programs to provide services for applications.

- Utility programs.
- Command interpreters.
- Programming libraries.

The **execution environment** provides by the OS includes a variety of **abstractions**.

- **Files and file systems**. Secondary storage.
- **Address spaces**. Primary memory (RAM).
- **Processes, threads**. Program execution.
- **Sockets, pipes**. Network or other message channels.

# Threads and Concurrency

> Better utilization of the CPU.

What is a tread? It is a sequence of instructions.

- A normal **sequential program** consists of a single thread of execution.
- Threads provide a way for programmers to express **concurrency** in a program.
- In threaded concurrent programs, there are multiple threads of execution, all occuring at the same time.

OS/161 Thread Interface.

    kern/include/thread.h

    int thread_fork(
        const char* name,
        struct proc* proc,
        void (*func)(void*, unsigned long),
        void* data1,
        unsigned long data2);

    // Terminate the calling thread.
    void thread_exit(void);

    // Voluntarily yield execution.
    void thread_yield(void);
