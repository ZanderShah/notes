# Minimum Cut

> Find a minimum cardinality subset of edges to disconnect a graph.

## Karger's Algorithm

> Contract a random edge.

While there are more than two vertices in the graph, choose a uniformly random edge $uv$ and contract the two endpoints. Output the edges between the remaining two vertices.

**Theorem**: Success probability of returning a min-cut is at least $\frac{2}{n(n-1)}$.

> Let $F \le E$ be a minimum cut, say $|F| = k$. The probability that we don't choose an edge in $F$ in the $i$-th iteration is $\frac{|F|}{|E|}$. In the $i$-th iteration, we have $(n - i + 1)$ vertices. The minimum cut is assumed to be at least $k$, so the minimum degree is also at least $k$, so the number of edges is at least $\frac{(n - i + 1) k}{2}$. So probability for the $i$-th iteration is upper-bounded by $\frac{2}{n - i + 1}$

Let us repeat $T$ many times, taking the best result. The failure probability is now $\left(1 - \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\right)^T \le e^{\frac{-2T}{n(n-1)}}$.
