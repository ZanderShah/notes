## Fundamental Goals of Cryptography

- **Confidentiality**: Keeping data secret from all not authorized.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data has not been altered by unauthorized means.
- **Data Origin Authentication**: Corroborating the source of data.
- **Non-Repudiation**: Prevents entity from denying previous commitments or actions.

**Symmetric-key cryptography**: The **client** and **server** share some **secret** information $k$, called a **key**.

**Public-key cryptography**: Share an **authenticated** (but not secret) information.

### SSL Protocol

1. Server transmits **certificate** to client.
    - Contains server's identifying information, with **RSA** public key and signature of **certifying authority**.
    - Certifying authority is trusted.
2. Client **verifies** signature to verify **authenticity**.
3. Client selects random key $k$ and **encrypts** with server's RSA public key, transmits ciphertext to server.
4. Server **decrpyts** ciphertext.

Is SSL **really** secure?

There are many potential security vulnerabilities.

1. Crypto is weak (e.g. AES, HMAC, RSA).
2. **Quantum attacks** on underlying cryptography.
3. Weak random number generation.
4. Fraudulent certificates.
    - Mistakes due to human error.
5. Software bugs (both inadvertent and malicious).
6. **Phishing** attacks.
7. SSL only protects data during transit, does not protect data when it is collected at the server.

Crypto might be strong, but **information security** is more difficult (**cybersecurity**).

- Cryptography providers some mathematical tools to assist, but it is a **small** part of the entire solution.
