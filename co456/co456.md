## Game of Nim

We are given a collection of piles of chips. Two players play alternately. On a player's turn, they remove at least one chip from a pile. The first player who cannot move loses the game.

**Example**.

> **1, 1, 2**. First player takes both chips from the 2-pile, forces a win.
>
> **6, 9**. First player takes 3 from the 9-pile, mimic the moves of the second player to force a win.

If there is a move which forces a win, then the game is a **winning position**. From a **losing position**, any move leads to a winning position for the other player.

**Lemma**: If we have exactly 2 piles, with $n$, $m$ chips, then player I wins if and only if $n \neq m$.

## Impartial Games

### Conditions

1. There are exactly 2 players (player I and II).
2. There are several positions, with a starting position.
3. A player performs one of a set of allowed moves, which depends on only the current position (not on the player whose turn it is). "Impartial" (not chess). Each move generates an **option**.
4. The players move alternately.
5. There is complete information.
6. There are no chance moves.
7. The first player with no available move loses.
8. The rules guarantee that the games ends.

**Example**. $G = (1, 1, 2)$ game in Nim. Four possible moves.

> $$G = (1, 1, 2) \rightarrow \begin{cases}&H_1 = (1, 1, 1) \\ &H_2 = (1, 1, 0) \\ &H_3 = (0, 1, 2) \\\ &H_4 = (1, 0, 2)\end{cases}$$

> Impartial games can be recursively defined by its position and options.

**Definition**: A game $H$ that is reachable from $G$ by a sequence of moves is **simpler** than $G$.

**Lemma**: In any game $G$, it is a winning position for player I or player II.

> We proceed by induction on the simplicity of $G$. If $G$ has no allowed moves, then it is a winning position for the player not in their turn. Assume $G$ has allowed moves, assume claim is true for games simpler than $G$. Assume player I is the current player. Consider all options of $G$. If one of them is a winning position for player I, then player I moves to that option, wins that game, then also wins $G$. Otherwise, all options are winning positions for player II. So any move player I makes will make player II win. So $G$ is a winning position for player II.
