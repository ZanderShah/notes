## Game of Nim

We are given a collection of piles of chips. Two players play alternately. On a player's turn, they remove at least one chip from a pile. The first player who cannot move loses the game.

**Example**.

> **1, 1, 2**. First player takes both chips from the 2-pile, forces a win.
>
> **6, 9**. First player takes 3 from the 9-pile, mimic the moves of the second player to force a win.

If there is a move which forces a win, then the game is a **winning position**. From a **losing position**, any move leads to a winning position for the other player.

**Lemma**: If we have exactly 2 piles, with $n$, $m$ chips, then player I wins if and only if $n \neq m$.

## Impartial Games

### Conditions

1. There are exactly 2 players (player I and II).
2. There are several positions, with a starting position.
3. A player performs one of a set of allowed moves, which depends on only the current position (not on the player whose turn it is). "Impartial" (not chess). Each move generates an **option**.
4. The players move alternately.
5. There is complete information.
6. There are no chance moves.
7. The first player with no available move loses.
8. The rules guarantee that the games ends.

**Example**. $G = (1, 1, 2)$ game in Nim. Four possible moves.

> $$G = (1, 1, 2) \rightarrow \begin{cases}&H_1 = (1, 1, 1) \\ &H_2 = (1, 1, 0) \\ &H_3 = (0, 1, 2) \\\ &H_4 = (1, 0, 2)\end{cases}$$
>
> Impartial games can be recursively defined by its position and options.

**Definition**: A game $H$ that is reachable from $G$ by a sequence of moves is **simpler** than $G$.

**Lemma**: In any game $G$, it is a winning position for player I or player II.

> We proceed by induction on the simplicity of $G$. If $G$ has no allowed moves, then it is a winning position for the player not in their turn. Assume $G$ has allowed moves, assume claim is true for games simpler than $G$. Assume player I is the current player. Consider all options of $G$. If one of them is a winning position for player I, then player I moves to that option, wins that game, then also wins $G$. Otherwise, all options are winning positions for player II. So any move player I makes will make player II win. So $G$ is a winning position for player II.

### Game Sums

**Definition**: Let $G$, $H$ be two games with options $G_1, ..., G_m$, and $H_1, ..., H_n$ respectively. We define $G + H$ as the game with options $G_1 + H, ..., G_m + H, G + H_1, ..., G + H_n$.

**Example**: We denote $\star n$ to be a game of Nim with one pile of $n$ chips. Then $\star 1 + \star 1 + \star 2$ is the game of three piles with $(1, 1, 2)$ chips.

Let $\bf G$ be the set of all impartial games.

1. $G + H \in \bf G$ for any $G, H \in \bf G$ (closure).
2. $(G + H) + J = G + (H + J)$ (associative).
3. There exists $0 \in \bf G$ where $0 + G = G + 0 = G$ for all $G \in \bf G$. 0 is the game with no options.
4. $G + H = H + G$ for all $G, H \in \bf G$ (symmetric).

> **Aside**: These are properties of an abelian group except for the inverse property.

### Game Equivalences

**Definition**: Two games $G, H$ are **equivalent** is if for any game $J$, $G + J$ is a losing game if and only if $H + J$ is a losing game. Adding the same game does not alter the outcome.

**Notation**: $G \equiv H$.

**Example**: $\star 3 \equiv \star 3$. $\star 3 \not\equiv \star 4$ since $\star 3 + \star 3$ is a losing game and $\star 4 + \star 3$ is a winning game. So $\star n \equiv \star m$ if and only if $n = m$.

$\equiv$ is an equivalence relation.

1. Reflexive. $G \equiv G$.
2. Symmetric. $G \equiv H$ if and only if $H \equiv G$.
3. Transitive. If $G \equiv H$ and $H \equiv K$, then $G \equiv K$.

> Quick exercise to verify.

**Exercise**: If $G \equiv H$ then $G + J \equiv H + J$ for any $J$.

**Lemma**: $G$ is a losing game if and only if $G \equiv \star 0$.

> **Note**: Start of proving that every impartial game is equivalent to a some Nim game.
>
> $(\Leftarrow)$ If $G \equiv \star 0$, then $G + \star 0$ is a losing game if and only if $\star 0 + \star 0$ is a losing game. We know $\star 0 + \star 0$ is a losing game.
>
> $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $G$ is a losing game. We want to show $G + J$ is a losing game if and only if $\star 0 + J = J$ is a losing game.
>
> $(\leftarrow)$ Suppose $J$ is a losing game. Use induction on the simplicity of $G + J$. Base case $\equiv$ if left as an exercise. Consider $G + J$. Player I can move in $G$ or in $J$.
>
> 1. Suppose player I moves from $G + J$ to $G + J^\prime$. Since $J$ is a losing game, $J^\prime$ is a winning game. So player II has a winning move from $J^\prime$ to $J^{\prime\prime}$ such that $J^{\prime\prime}$ is a losing game. By induction, $G + J^{\prime\prime}$ is a losing game. So player I loses.
> 2. Similar if we go from $G + J$ to $G^\prime + J$. Player II moves to $G^{\prime\prime} + J$ which is by induction a losing game. So player I loses.
>
> So in both cases, $G + J$ is a losing game.
>
> $(\rightarrow)$ Suppose $G + J$ is a losing game. Suppose by way of contradiction $J$ is a winning game. Then PI has a winning move $J \to J^\prime$. So $J^\prime$ is a losing game. Then by induction, $G + J^\prime$ is a losing game. Then $G + J$ is a winning game, contradiction.

**Corollary**: If $G$ is a losing game, then $J$ has the same outcome as $J + G$.

> Since $G$ is a losing game, $G \equiv \star 0$. Add $J$ to both sides. $G + J \equiv \star 0 + J = J$.

**Example**:

1. Recall that $\star 5 + \star 5$ and $\star 8 + \star 8$ are both losing games. By corollary, $\star 5 + \star 5 + \star 8 + \star 8$ is still a losing game. Player I can either play in $\star 5 + \star 5$ or $\star 8 + \star 8$. Player II will make a winning move in the same part of the game. So we still end up with a losing game.
2. $(\star 1 + \star 1 + \star 2) + (\star 5 + \star 5)$ is a winning game and a losing game. Player I makes winning move in $(\star 1 + \star 1 + \star 2)$. Player II has two losing parts. So we still end up with a losing game.

**Lemma** (Copycat Principle): For any game $G$, $G + G \equiv \star 0$.

> This is true when $G$ has no options. Consider $G + G$ and without loss of generality player I moves to $G^\prime + G$. Then player II can move to $G^\prime + G^\prime$. By induction $G^\prime + G^\prime \equiv \star 0$, so it is a losing game for player I. So $G + G$ is a losing game, so $G + G \equiv \star 0$.
>
> **Aside**: If we treat our games as equivalence classes, then the inverse of a game is itself. Adding $G + G$ gives the identity $\star 0$.

**Lemma**: $G \equiv H$ if and only if $G + H \equiv \star 0$.

> $(\Rightarrow)$ If $G \equiv H$ then $G + G = \star 0 \equiv H + G$.
>
> $(\Leftarrow)$ If $G + H \equiv \star 0$ then $G + G + H \equiv H \equiv \star 0 + G \equiv G$

**Example**: $\star 1 + \star 2 + \star 3 \equiv \star 0$. By Lemma, $\star 1 + \star 2 \equiv \star 3$.

**Lemma**: If the options of $G$ are equivalent to the options of $H$, then $G \equiv H$. (More precisely: there is a bijection between the options of $G$ and $H$, where the paired options are equivalent).

**Example**: We can show $\star 1 + \star 2 \equiv \star 3$ using this lemma.

> $$\star 1 + \star 2 \rightarrow \begin{cases}&\star 2 \\ &\star 1 \\ &\star 1 + \star 1 \equiv \star 0 \end{cases}$$
> $$\star 3 \rightarrow \begin{cases}&\star 2 \\ &\star 1 \\ &\star 0  \end{cases}$$

Converse is not true.

> It suffices to show $G + H \equiv \star 0$, or $G + H$ is a losing game. If $G, H$ have no options, then $G + H \equiv \star 0$. Now WLOG, suppose player I moves to $G^\prime + H$. By assumption, $G^\prime \equiv H^\prime$ for some option $H^\prime$ of $H$. So player II moves to $G^\prime + H^\prime$. By Lemma, $G^\prime + H^\prime \equiv \star 0$, so it is a losing game for player I.

### Nim Sums

**Definition**: If $\star m + \star n \equiv \star k$, then $k$ is the Nim sum of $m, n$.

**Theorem**: Suppose $n = 2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + ...$, where $a_1 > a_2 > ...$. Then $\star n \equiv \star 2^{a_1} + \star 2^{a_2} + ...$.

**Examples**.

1. $11 = 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0$. So $\star 11 \equiv \star 8 + \star 2 + \star 1$.
2. $13 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0$. So $\star 13 \equiv \star 8 + \star 4 + \star 1$.
3. $\star 11 + \star 13 \equiv \star 8 + \star 8 + \star 4 + \star 2 + \star 1 + \star 1 \equiv \star 4 + \star 2 \equiv 6$.

> This is an xor operation.

When is $\star b_1 + \star b_2 + ... + \star b_k \equiv \star 0$? When each power of $2^a$ appears in even number of terms.

Given $\star b_1 + \star b_2 + ... + \star b_k \equiv \star c$, where $c > 0$, what is a winning move? We want to make a move so the resulting game is equivalent to $\star 0$. We add $\star c$ to both sides. We only affect one stack, so we can replace a stack $b_i$ with $\star b_i + \star c$. This is only valid if the Nim sum of $b_i$ and $c$ is strictly smaller than $b_i$. This will happen to at least one of $b_1, ..., b_k$.

**Example**: $\star 11 + \star 13 \equiv \star 6$. Add $\star 6$ to $\star 11$ or $\star 13$.

> $\star 13 + \star 6 \equiv \star 11$, so the winning move is removing $2$ from $\star 13$.
