<h2 id="game-of-nim">Game of Nim</h2>
<p>We are given a collection of piles of chips. Two players play alternately. On a player’s turn, they remove at least one chip from a pile. The first player who cannot move loses the game.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1, 1, 2</strong>. First player takes both chips from the 2-pile, forces a win.</p>
<p><strong>6, 9</strong>. First player takes 3 from the 9-pile, mimic the moves of the second player to force a win.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is a move which forces a win, then the game is a <strong>winning position</strong>. From a <strong>losing position</strong>, any move leads to a winning position for the other player.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: If we have exactly 2 piles, with <span class="math inline">n</span>, <span class="math inline">m</span> chips, then player I wins if and only if <span class="math inline">n \neq m</span>.</p>
<h2 id="impartial-games">Impartial Games</h2>
<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>There are exactly 2 players (player I and II).</li>
<li>There are several positions, with a starting position.</li>
<li>A player performs one of a set of allowed moves, which depends on only the current position (not on the player whose turn it is). “Impartial” (not chess). Each move generates an <strong>option</strong>.</li>
<li>The players move alternately.</li>
<li>There is complete information.</li>
<li>There are no chance moves.</li>
<li>The first player with no available move loses.</li>
<li>The rules guarantee that the games ends.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>. <span class="math inline">G = (1, 1, 2)</span> game in Nim. Four possible moves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">G = (1, 1, 2) \rightarrow \begin{cases}&amp;H_1 = (1, 1, 1) \\ &amp;H_2 = (1, 1, 0) \\ &amp;H_3 = (0, 1, 2) \\\ &amp;H_4 = (1, 0, 2)\end{cases}</span></p>
<p>Impartial games can be recursively defined by its position and options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A game <span class="math inline">H</span> that is reachable from <span class="math inline">G</span> by a sequence of moves is <strong>simpler</strong> than <span class="math inline">G</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: In any game <span class="math inline">G</span>, it is a winning position for player I or player II.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We proceed by induction on the simplicity of <span class="math inline">G</span>. If <span class="math inline">G</span> has no allowed moves, then it is a winning position for the player not in their turn. Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> has allowed moves, assume claim is true for games simpler than <span class="math inline">G</span>. Assume player I is the current player. Consider all options of <span class="math inline">G</span>. If one of them is a winning position for player I, then player I moves to that option, wins that game, then also wins <span class="math inline">G</span>. Otherwise, all options are winning positions for player II. So any move player I makes will make player II win. So <span class="math inline">G</span> is a winning position for player II.</p>

<h3 id="game-sums">Game Sums</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">G</span>, <span class="math inline">H</span> be two games with options <span class="math inline">G_1, ..., G_m</span>, and <span class="math inline">H_1, ..., H_n</span> respectively. We define <span class="math inline">G + H</span> as the game with options <span class="math inline">G_1 + H, ..., G_m + H, G + H_1, ..., G + H_n</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: We denote <span class="math inline">\star n</span> to be a game of Nim with one pile of <span class="math inline">n</span> chips. Then <span class="math inline">\star 1 + \star 1 + \star 2</span> is the game of three piles with <span class="math inline">(1, 1, 2)</span> chips.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\bf G</span> be the set of all impartial games.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">G + H \in \bf G</span> for any <span class="math inline">G, H \in \bf G</span> (closure).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">(G + H) + J = G + (H + J)</span> (associative).</li>
<li>There exists <span class="math inline">0 \in \bf G</span> where <span class="math inline">0 + G = G + 0 = G</span> for all <span class="math inline">G \in \bf G</span>. 0 is the game with no options.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">G + H = H + G</span> for all <span class="math inline">G, H \in \bf G</span> (symmetric).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="game-equivalences">Game Equivalences</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Two games <span class="math inline">G, H</span> are <strong>equivalent</strong> is if for any game <span class="math inline">J</span>, <span class="math inline">G + J</span> is a losing game if and only if <span class="math inline">H + J</span> is a losing game. Adding the same game does not alter the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Notation</strong>: <span class="math inline">G \equiv H</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: <span class="math inline">\star 3 \equiv \star 3</span>. <span class="math inline">\star 3 \not\equiv \star 4</span> since <span class="math inline">\star 3 + \star 3</span> is a losing game and <span class="math inline">\star 4 + \star 3</span> is a winning game. So <span class="math inline">\star n \equiv \star m</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">n = m</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\equiv</span> is an equivalence relation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reflexive. <span class="math inline">G \equiv G</span>.</li>
<li>Symmetric. <span class="math inline">G \equiv H</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">H \equiv G</span>.</li>
<li>Transitive. If <span class="math inline">G \equiv H</span> and <span class="math inline">H \equiv K</span>, then <span class="math inline">G \equiv K</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Quick exercise to verify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: If <span class="math inline">G \equiv H</span> then <span class="math inline">G + J \equiv H + J</span> for any <span class="math inline">J</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: <span class="math inline">G</span> is a losing game if and only if <span class="math inline">G \equiv \star 0</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Start of proving that every impartial game is equivalent to a some Nim game.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">(\Leftarrow)</span> If <span class="math inline">G \equiv \star 0</span>, then <span class="math inline">G + \star 0</span> is a losing game if and only if <span class="math inline">\star 0 + \star 0</span> is a losing game. We know <span class="math inline">\star 0 + \star 0</span> is a losing game.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">(\Rightarrow)</span> Suppose that <span class="math inline">G</span> is a losing game. We want to show <span class="math inline">G + J</span> is a losing game if and only if <span class="math inline">\star 0 + J = J</span> is a losing game.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">(\leftarrow)</span> Suppose <span class="math inline">J</span> is a losing game. Use induction on the simplicity of <span class="math inline">G + J</span>. Base case <span class="math inline">\equiv</span> if left as an exercise. Consider <span class="math inline">G + J</span>. Player I can move in <span class="math inline">G</span> or in <span class="math inline">J</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Suppose player I moves from <span class="math inline">G + J</span> to <span class="math inline">G + J^\prime</span>. Since <span class="math inline">J</span> is a losing game, <span class="math inline">J^\prime</span> is a winning game. So player II has a winning move from <span class="math inline">J^\prime</span> to <span class="math inline">J^{\prime\prime}</span> such that <span class="math inline">J^{\prime\prime}</span> is a losing game. By induction, <span class="math inline">G + J^{\prime\prime}</span> is a losing game. So player I loses.</li>
<li>Similar if we go from <span class="math inline">G + J</span> to <span class="math inline">G^\prime + J</span>. Player II moves to <span class="math inline">G^{\prime\prime} + J</span> which is by induction a losing game. So player I loses.</li>
</ol>
<p>So in both cases, <span class="math inline">G + J</span> is a losing game.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">(\rightarrow)</span> Suppose <span class="math inline">G + J</span> is a losing game. Suppose by way of contradiction <span class="math inline">J</span> is a winning game. Then PI has a winning move <span class="math inline">J \to J^\prime</span>. So <span class="math inline">J^\prime</span> is a losing game. Then by induction, <span class="math inline">G + J^\prime</span> is a losing game. Then <span class="math inline">G + J</span> is a winning game, contradiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong>: If <span class="math inline">G</span> is a losing game, then <span class="math inline">J</span> has the same outcome as <span class="math inline">J + G</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">G</span> is a losing game, <span class="math inline">G \equiv \star 0</span>. Add <span class="math inline">J</span> to both sides. <span class="math inline">G + J \equiv \star 0 + J = J</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Recall that <span class="math inline">\star 5 + \star 5</span> and <span class="math inline">\star 8 + \star 8</span> are both losing games. By corollary, <span class="math inline">\star 5 + \star 5 + \star 8 + \star 8</span> is still a losing game. Player I can either play in <span class="math inline">\star 5 + \star 5</span> or <span class="math inline">\star 8 + \star 8</span>. Player II will make a winning move in the same part of the game. So we still end up with a losing game.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">(\star 1 + \star 1 + \star 2) + (\star 5 + \star 5)</span> is a winning game and a losing game. Player I makes winning move in <span class="math inline">(\star 1 + \star 1 + \star 2)</span>. Player II has two losing parts. So we still end up with a losing game.</li>
