<h2 id="game-of-nim">Game of Nim</h2>
<p>We are given a collection of piles of chips. Two players play alternately. On a player’s turn, they remove at least one chip from a pile. The first player who cannot move loses the game.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1, 1, 2</strong>. First player takes both chips from the 2-pile, forces a win.</p>
<p><strong>6, 9</strong>. First player takes 3 from the 9-pile, mimic the moves of the second player to force a win.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is a move which forces a win, then the game is a <strong>winning position</strong>. From a <strong>losing position</strong>, any move leads to a winning position for the other player.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: If we have exactly 2 piles, with <span class="math inline">n</span>, <span class="math inline">m</span> chips, then player I wins if and only if <span class="math inline">n \neq m</span>.</p>
<h2 id="impartial-games">Impartial Games</h2>
<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>There are exactly 2 players (player I and II).</li>
<li>There are several positions, with a starting position.</li>
<li>A player performs one of a set of allowed moves, which depends on only the current position (not on the player whose turn it is). “Impartial” (not chess). Each move generates an <strong>option</strong>.</li>
<li>The players move alternately.</li>
<li>There is complete information.</li>
<li>There are no chance moves.</li>
<li>The first player with no available move loses.</li>
<li>The rules guarantee that the games ends.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>. <span class="math inline">G = (1, 1, 2)</span> game in Nim. Four possible moves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">G = (1, 1, 2) \rightarrow \begin{cases}&amp;H_1 = (1, 1, 1) \\ &amp;H_2 = (1, 1, 0) \\ &amp;H_3 = (0, 1, 2) \\\ &amp;H_4 = (1, 0, 2)\end{cases}</span></p>
<p>Impartial games can be recursively defined by its position and options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A game <span class="math inline">H</span> that is reachable from <span class="math inline">G</span> by a sequence of moves is <strong>simpler</strong> than <span class="math inline">G</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: In any game <span class="math inline">G</span>, it is a winning position for player I or player II.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We proceed by induction on the simplicity of <span class="math inline">G</span>. If <span class="math inline">G</span> has no allowed moves, then it is a winning position for the player not in their turn. Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> has allowed moves, assume claim is true for games simpler than <span class="math inline">G</span>. Assume player I is the current player. Consider all options of <span class="math inline">G</span>. If one of them is a winning position for player I, then player I moves to that option, wins that game, then also wins <span class="math inline">G</span>. Otherwise, all options are winning positions for player II. So any move player I makes will make player II win. So <span class="math inline">G</span> is a winning position for player II.</p>
