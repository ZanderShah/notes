<h1 id="introduction">1: Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-internet">1.1 What <em>is</em> the Internet?</h2>
<p>Millions of connected computing devices. - <strong>hosts</strong> = <strong>end systems</strong> - running <strong>network apps</strong></p>
<h2 id="internet-protocol-stack">Internet protocol stack</h2>
<p><strong>Application</strong>: Running the network applications that you want (HTTP, FTP, SMTP). Implemented using software only.<br />
<strong>Transport</strong>: Responsible for communication of processes between layers. Mainly implemented using software.<br />
<strong>Network</strong>: Responsible for routing from source to destination. Implemented using software and hardware.<br />
<strong>Link</strong>: Transfering to data between physically connected (adjacent) hubs (e.g. Computer -&gt; Router, Router -&gt; Router …). Hardware.<br />
<strong>Physical</strong>: How you are transfering physical bits on the wire. Not coverted in this course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the internet, there were two extra section that were planned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong>: Applications to interpret meaning of data (e.g. encryption, compression, etc.).<br />
<strong>Session</strong>: Synchronization, checkpointing.</p>
<p>If you want these features, it must be implemented in the application layer.</p>
<h3 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>
<p><strong>Switch</strong>: Link and physical layers. <strong>Router</strong>: Network, link, and physical layers.</p>
<p>Information is added from the above layer to the lower.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Transport</strong>: Segment<br />
<strong>Network Layer</strong>: Datagram<br />
<strong>Link Layer</strong>: Frame</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When passing data through, you need to pop the stack (<strong>decapsulation</strong>) and then replace (<strong>encapsulation</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="network-security">Network Security</h2>
<p>Internet was not desigend with security in mind. How can bad guys attack and how can we defend? How can we design architechtures that are immune to attacks.</p>
<p>In real life: Hackers hack your system and then you fix the error and catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Malware</strong> any harmful software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Virus</strong>: Interaction required.<br />
<strong>Worm</strong>: Weakness in application you are already running.<br />
<strong>Spyware</strong>: Record keystrokes, web sites, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Infected hosts can be enrolled in <strong>botnet</strong> to help in future attacks.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-attacks">Examples of Attacks</h3>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong>: Attackers infect local computers with a worm in order to all send messages to the target at the same time. Target will be busy services request so they cannot service normal customers.</p>
<p><strong>Packet “sniffing”</strong>: Passive program that is on the link which listens to and records packets.</p>
<p><strong>IP spoofing</strong>: Send a message with a false source address.</p>
<p><strong>Routers</strong>: Implements the bottom 3 layers (network, data link, physical).</p>
<p><strong>Switches</strong>: Implements the bottom 2 layers (data link, physical).</p>
<h1 id="application-layer">2: Application Layer</h1>
<h2 id="principles-of-network-applications">2.1: Principles of network applications</h2>
<h3 id="creating-a-network-app">Creating a network app</h3>
<p>Only write to run on end systems (not on the internal network). Does not matter if they are servers or clients. We also only care about what we want to do on the application layer and then push to the transport layer which will take care of transmitting the data. This allows for fast developement.</p>
<p><strong>Client-Server</strong>: Server is always on with a static IP. Client will communicate with servers (intermittent). Client IP addresses will be dynamic.<br />
<strong>P2P</strong>: Arbitrary end systems directly communicate. Peers request service from other peers and provice service in return (<em>self scalability</em>). There is more complex management because there is no central network that controls all uses. Security is also a big issue.</p>
<h3 id="process-communication">Process communication</h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: program running within a host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within same host, two process communication using <em>inter-process communication</em> defined by the OS.</li>
<li>Processes in different hosts communicate by exchaning messages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Client process</strong>: Process that initiates communication.<br />
<strong>Server process</strong>: Process that waits to be contacted.</p>
<p>Process sends / recieves messages to / from it’s <strong>socket</strong>.<br />
<strong>Socket</strong>: The gate between the application layer and the transport layer. Sockets are similar to doors. Sending process shoves message out of door and relies on the other side of the door to deliver message to the socket at the recieving process.</p>
<p>Example: Chrome tabs. How do we know which tab to put data? There is an identifier for each socket to route the data to the correct tab (You will always talk to port 80 of a server for HTTP requests but you will use a random port).</p>
<p><strong>Sockets</strong> consists of two parts (for now).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Address of host.</li>
<li>Port number.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of the two parts will create a <strong>unique identifier</strong> for the socket. Each process has it’s own unique socket (there are over 65k ports).</p>
<h3 id="application-layer-protocol-defines">Application layer protocol defines …</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rules</strong> for when and how process send and respond to messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Types of messages exchanged</strong>: Request, response.<br />
<strong>Message syntax</strong>: What does each field mean and how fields are delineated.<br />
<strong>Message semantics</strong>: What do you want the information in the fields to mean.</p>
<p>Examples of open protocols are <strong>HTTP</strong> and <strong>DNS</strong> which are defined in RFCs (<em>Request For Comments</em> is a formal document from the Internet Engineering Task Force). An example of a proprietary protocol is <strong>Skype</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-transport-services-does-an-application-need">What transport services does an application need?</h3>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Data Integrity</strong>. Some applications require 100% data transfer whereas other applications (e.g. audio) can tolerate some loss.</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>. Time sensitive applications (e.g. Internet telephone, interactive games) require low delay to be <em>effective</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Throughput</strong> (How fast the data can be transfered). Some applications require a minimum amount to be <em>effective</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>. Encryption.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>TCP</strong> (<em>Transport Control Protocol</em>)
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliable transport</strong> between sending and recieving process. Everything will get there without errors and in order.</li>
<li><strong>Flow control</strong>: Sender won’t overwhelm reciever.</li>
<li><strong>Congestion control</strong>: Throttle sender when network is overloaded.</li>
<li><strong>Does not provide</strong>: Timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security.</li>

<h3 id="securing-tcp">Securing TCP</h3>
<p><strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>UDP</strong> have no encryption. Plaintext passwords send into sockets.</p>
<p>If you want security, you can use <strong>SSL</strong> (<em>secury socket layer</em>) which provices encryption for <strong>TCP</strong> connection. <strong>SSL</strong> is used at the application layer (need to use a <strong>SSL</strong> library such as OpenSSL).</p>
<h2 id="web-and-http">2.2: Web and HTTP</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>web page</em> consists of <em>objects</em>. (HTML, JPEG, Java applet, auto file, …).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Web page consists of <strong>base HTML-file</strong> which includes several referenced objects.</li>
<li>Each object is addressable by a <strong>URL</strong> (Uniform Resource Locator).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HTTP</strong> (hypertext transfer protocol): We have a client / server model. The client sends requests to the server and the server replies with an HTTP request.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>HTTP uses TCP. The client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80. (A random port is used on the client side).</li>
<li>Server accepts TCP connection from client.</li>
<li>HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server).</li>
<li>TCP connection closed.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>HTTP is “stateless”</em>. The server maintains no information about past client requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Protocols that maintain “state” are complex. Past history must be maintained and if the client / server crashes, their views of the “state” may be inconsistent.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="types-of-http-connections">Types of HTTP Connections</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Non-Persistent HTTP</strong>
<ul>
<li>At most one object sent over TCP connection.</li>
<li>Downloading multiple objects requires multiple connections.</li>
<li>Server is free more frequently to server other users.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Persistent HTTP</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple objects sent over a single TCP connection.</li>
<li>Avoid eccessive overhead when requesting multiple objects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="response-time">Response Time</h3>
<p><strong>RTT</strong> (<em>Round Trip Time</em>): Time it takes a small packet to travel from client to server and back.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Response Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One RTT to initiate TCP</li>
<li>One RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response in return.</li>
<li>File transmition time (<em>transmission delay</em>).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Non-Persistent HTTP Response Time = 2RTT + transmission time.<br />
Persistent HTTP Response Time = RTT + n(RTT + transmission time).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For non-persistent HTTP, we require 2 RTT per object. There is OS overhead for <em>each</em> TCP connection. Browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects.</p>
<p>For persistent HTTP, subsequent HTTP messages between client / server will be over the same connection so the client will sent requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object. There is as little as on RTT per referenced object.</p>
<h3 id="http-request">HTTP Request</h3>

</ol>
<p>Cookies are used to keep <strong>state</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="web-caches-proxy-server">Web Caches (Proxy Server)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Satisfy client request without involving the original server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All requests are sent through a proxy server instead which caches requests and responses. If the request is already cached, it does not have to travel all the way to the original server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically the cache is insalled by ISP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Average object size: <span class="math inline">\(100\ K bits\)</span>.<br />
Average request rate: <span class="math inline">\(15\ /\ sec\)</span>.<br />
RTT from insitutional router to original server: <span class="math inline">\(2\ sec\)</span><br />
Access link rate: <span class="math inline">\(1.54\ Mbps\)</span></p>
<p>We then have LAN utilization: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.5\ Mbps}{1\ Gbps} = 0.15\%\)</span><br />
Access link utilization: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.5\ Mbps}{1.54\ Mbps} = 97.4\%\)</span><br />
Total Delay = Internet Delay + Access Delay + LAN Delay<br />
Access Delay: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{100\ K}{(1 - 0.974)1.54\ Mbps}\)</span>. (New users can only use whatever is left of the access link).<br />
LAN Delay: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{100\ K}{(1 - 0.0015)1\ Gbps}\)</span><br />
Total Delay <span class="math inline">\(= 2 + 2.5 + 0.0001\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solutions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Get a faster access link. If the access link rate was increased to <span class="math inline">\(154\ Mbps\)</span>, the access link delay drops to <span class="math inline">\(0.0007\)</span> so the total delay is only <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> sec.</p></li>
<li><p>Caching. If the cache hit rate was 0.4, 40% of requests are satisfied at the cache. The data rate to browsers over the access link is <span class="math inline">\(0.6 \cdot 1.50\ Mbps = 0.9\ Mbps\)</span>. Utilization becomes <span class="math inline">\(0.58\)</span>. Total Delay <span class="math inline">\(= 0.6 \cdot\)</span>(delay from original servers) + <span class="math inline">\(0.4 \cdot\)</span>(delay when satisfied by the cache) <span class="math inline">\(= 0.6(2.15) = 1.29\ sec\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conditional GET</strong> - If the cache has an up-to-date version, don’t send the object. - The web server sends a conditional get with the <em>If-modified-since</em>. - Response code <strong>304 Not Modified</strong> if the cached version is fine. - Response code <strong>200 OK</strong> will send the updated data.</p>

<p>When we want the speed to be as fast as possible and we are loss tolerant.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>“No frills”, “bare bones” Internet transport protocol.</li>
<li>“Best effort” service, UDP segments may be lost or delivered out-of-order to app.</li>
<li><strong>Connectionless</strong> meaning that there is no handshaking between UDP sender and reciever. Each UDP segment is handled independently of others.</li>
<li>UDP is used in streaming multimedia apps, DNS, SNPM (Simple Network Management Protocol).</li>
<li>Reliable transfer over UDP can be achieved by adding reliability at the application layer such as application-specific error recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>UDP adds a segment header of 64 bits. The first 32 are used for the source port number and the destination port number. The next 16 are used for the length in bytes of the segment (including header), and the final 16 are used for <strong>checksum</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="udp-checksum">UDP Checksum</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to detect “errors” (e.g. flipped bits) in transmitted segmet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sender treats the segment’s contents as a sequence of 16-bit integers. The checksum is the addition (one’s complement sum) of segment contents. The reciever then computes their own checksum and compares. (When adding numbers, a carryout from the msb gets re-added to the result).</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-reliable-data-transfer">3.4 Principles of Reliable Data Transfer</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we have a reliable channel, we do not have to worry about reliable data transfer.</li>
<li>Characteristics of unreliable channels will determine the complexity of reliable data transfer protocol (rdt).</li>
</ul>
<p>rdt_send() is called from the application layer whenever we have data to send which passes udt_send() to transfer the packet over the unreliable channel to reciever. It is recieved by rdt_rcv() which gets passed to the protocol on the transport layer. After some processing, it is passed to the upper application layer through deliver_data().</p>
<h3 id="rdt-1.0-reliable-transfer-over-a-reliable-channel.">RDT 1.0: Reliable transfer over a reliable channel.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Underlying channel is perfectly reliable. There are no bit errors and no loss of packets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have separate Finite State Machines (FSMs) for sender, reciever. The sender sends data into the underlying channel and the reciever reads data from the underlying channel.</p>
<h3 id="rdt-2.0-channel-with-bit-errors">RDT 2.0: Channel with Bit Errors</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Underlying channel may flip bits in packet which is detected by the checksum.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACKs</strong> (<em>acknowledgements</em>): The reciever explicity tells sender that the packet was recieved ok.</li>
<li><strong>NAKs</strong> (<em>negative acknowledgements</em>): The reciever explicity tells sender that the packet has errors.
<ul>
<li>Sender retransmits packet on receipt of NAK.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The sender needs to add a checksum to the data and will wait for ACK or NAK.</li>
<li>There is a <strong>fatal flaw</strong> because if ACK / NAK is corrupted, the sender does not know what happened at the reciever.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rdt-2.1">RDT 2.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>The sender retransmits the current packet if ACK / NAK is corrupted and adds a <em>sequence number</em> to each packet.
<ul>
<li>We only need 2 sequence numbers (0, 1) so that we can distinguish between consecutive messages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The reciever discards duplicate packets.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stop and Wait</strong> protocol: sender sends 1 packet and then waits for receiver response.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="rdt-2.2-nak-free">RDT 2.2: NAK-free</h4>
<ul>
<li>We can have less state transitions if we only use ACKs.</li>
<li>The reciever can send a packet number as well.</li>
<li>Duplicate ACK at sender results in the same action as NAK: <em>retransmit the current packet</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rdt-3.0-channels-with-errors-and-loss">RDT 3.0: Channels with Errors <em>and</em> Loss</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the underlying channel can also lose packets (data, ACKs).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Checksum, sequence number, ACKs, retransmission will be of help … but it is not enough.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The sender will wait a “reasonable” amount of time for ACK. It will retransmit if no ACK is received in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If packet of ACK is delayed (not lost), the retransmission would be a duplicate, but we already handle this with sequence numbers.</li>
<li>This approach works but the performance is bad.
<ul>
<li>Example: 1 Gbps link, 15 ms propogation delay, 8000 bit packet.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D_{trans} = \frac{L}{R} = \frac{8000\ bits}{10^9\ bits/sec} = 8\ \mu s\)</span>.<br />

<h3 id="tcp-round-trip-time-timeout">TCP Round Trip Time, Timeout</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How to set TCP timeout value?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be longer than the RTT, but the RTT varies. If it is too short, we will have unnecessary retransmissions. If it is too long, we will have slow reactions to segment loss.</p>
<p>We estimate RTT by sampling from segment transmissions. <span class="math inline">\(SampleRTT\)</span> is the measured time from segment transmission to ACK receipt (ignoring retransmissions). We use an exponential weighted moving average, <span class="math inline">\(EstimatedRTT = (1 - \alpha)\cdot EstimatedRTT + \alpha \cdot SampleRTT\)</span>. The typical value is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.125\)</span>.</p>
<p>Is this estimation enough? We want to add a <em>safety margin</em> so that a large variation in <span class="math inline">\(EstimateRTT\)</span> results in a larger safety margin. We use 4 standard deviations. <span class="math inline">\(DevRTT = (1 - \beta)\cdot DevRTT + \beta \cdot |SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|\)</span>.

</blockquote>
<p>Applications may remove data from TCP socket buffers slower than the TCP receiver is delivering (sender is sending).</p>

<li>Receiver “advertises” free buffer space by including <strong>rwnd</strong> value in the TCP header of receiver-to-sender segments.
<ul>
<li><strong>RcvBuffer</strong> size is set via socket options (typical default is 4096 bytes).</li>

<li>Each network link has a maximum transfer size (<em>MTU</em>).
<ul>
<li>Different link types, different MTUs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Large IP Datagram is divided within the network and <em>reassembled</em> only at the final destination.</li>
<li>IP header bits are used to identify and order related fragments.
<ul>
<li>Every fragement belonging to a datagram will have the same 16-bit id. Offset is measured in chunks of 8 bytes.</li>

<li><strong>Interface</strong>: Connection between host / router and physical link.
<ul>
<li>Routers typically have multiple interfaces.</li>
<li>Host typically has one or two interfaces (e.g. wired Ethernet, wireless 802.11).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="subnets">Subnets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP Address</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Subnet part, high order bits.</li>
<li>Host part, low order bits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Devices that have the same subnet part can physically reach each other <strong>without</strong> the need for a router.</li>
<li>To determine the subnets, detach each interface from its host or router and find the disjoint networks.</li>
<li>Subnets used to be classified into <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> where the subnet has <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span> bits respectively.</li>

<li>Address format is <span class="math inline">\(a.b.c.d/x\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the number of bits in the subnet portion of address.</li>
<li>In every subnet, we need to <strong>reserve</strong> two special IP addresses, when the host part is all 0s or all 1s.

</ul>
<h2 id="dhcp-overview">DHCP Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Host broadcasts <strong>DHCP discover</strong> message (<em>optional</em>).</li>
<li>DHCP server responds with <strong>DHCP offer</strong> message (<em>optional</em>).</li>
<li>Host requires IP address, <strong>DHCP request</strong>.</li>
<li>DHCP server sends address, <strong>DHCP ack</strong>.</li>
<li>Client sends to port 67, server sends to port 68.</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP can return more than just the allocated IP address on subnet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Address of first-hop router for client.</li>
<li>Name and IP address of DNS server.</li>
<li>Network mark (indicating network versus host portion of address).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/84O81pw.png" /></p>
<p>By doing bitwise &amp; between a host IP address and subnet mask, you will get the subnet portion of the host IP address.</p>
<p>How does <em>network</em> get subnet part of IP address? It gets an allocated portion of its provider ISP’s address space.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sHUVbUj.png" /></p>
<h2 id="heirarchical-addressing">Heirarchical Addressing</h2>
<p>Hierarchical addressing allows for efficient advertisement of routing information. Longest prefix match is used.</p>
<p>How does an ISP get a block of addresses? <strong>ICANN (I</strong>nternet <strong>C</strong>orporation for <strong>A</strong>ssigned <strong>N</strong>ames and <strong>N</strong>umbers) allocates addresses, manages DNS, assigns domain names, and resolves disputes.</p>
<h2 id="nat-network-address-translation">NAT (<em>Network Address Translation</em>)</h2>
<p>Households with one router only has one IP address. There may be multiple devices that need to connect, so the router does translation between local IP addresses and the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong> datagrams <strong>leaving</strong> the network have same single source NAT IP address.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: local network uses just one IP address as far as the outside world is concerned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Range of addresses is not needed from ISP.</li>
<li>Local network addresses can be changed without notifying the outside world.</li>
<li>ISP can be changed without changing addresses of devices in local network.</li>
<li>Devices inside local netwrok are not explicitly addressable which is a security plus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>: a NAT router must. - <strong>Outgoing datagrams: replace</strong> (source IP address, port number) of every outgoing datagram to (NAT IP address, new port number). - <strong>Remember (<em>in NAT translation table</em>)</strong> every (source IP address, port number) to (NAT IP address, new port number) translation pair. - <strong>Incoming datagrams: replace</strong> (NAT IP address, new port number) in destination fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding (source IP address, port number) sorted in NAT table.</p>
<p>NAT has a 16-bit port number field which allows for 60000 simultaneous connections with a single LAN-side address!</p>
<p>NAT is <strong>controversial</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Routers should only process up to layer 3.</li>
<li>Violates end-to-end argument.
<ul>
<li>NAT possibility must be taken into account by application designers, e.g. P2P applications.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Address shortage should instead be solved by IPv6.</li>

<li><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Statically configure NAT to forward incoming connection requests at given port to server.</li>
<li><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Internet Gateway Device (IGD) Protocol. Allows NATed host to.
<ul>
<li>Learn public IP address.</li>

<h2 id="routing-algorithms">4.5 Routing Algorithms</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Routing algorithm determines end-end path through the network. Forwarding table determines local forwarding at this router.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="routing-algorithm-classification">Routing Algorithm Classification</h3>
<p><strong>Global</strong>: All routers have complete topology and cost information (<em>link state</em> algorithms).</p>
<p><strong>Decentralized</strong>: Router knows only physically-connected neighbours. There is a iterative process of computation (<em>distance vector</em> algorithms).</p>
<p><strong>Static</strong>: Routes change slowly over time.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic</strong>: Periodic updates in response to link cost changes.</p>
<h3 id="link-state-routing-algorithm">Link-State Routing Algorithm</h3>
<p><strong>Dijkstra’s algorithm</strong> is used to compute least cost paths from one node (<em>source</em>) to all other nodes. Tracing predeccesor nodes gives a <strong>forwarding table</strong> for that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qsSMBN0.png" /></p>
<h4 id="link-state-problems">Link-State Problems</h4>
<p><strong>Oscillations</strong> are possible, when the support link cost is equal to the amount of carried traffic.</p>
<h3 id="distance-vector-routing-algorithm">Distance Vector Routing Algorithm</h3>
<p><strong>Bellman-Ford equation</strong> is used to compute least cost paths at each node. The node <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> that achieves the minimum cost for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the next-hop in the <strong>forwarding table</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ d_x(y) = \min_v\{c(x, v) + d_v(y)\}\]</span></p>
<p>Each node <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> knows the cost to each neighbour <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and maintains its neighbours distance vectors. For each neighbour <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> maintains <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}_v = [D_v(y), y \in N]\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> also maintains a distance vector for itself.</p>
<p>From time-to-time, each node sends its own distance vector estimate to its neighbours. When <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> receives a new distance vector estimate from a neighbour, it updates its own distance vector using the Bellman-Ford equation. Under minor, natural conditions, the estimate <span class="math inline">\(D_x(y)\)</span> will <strong>converge to the actual least cost <span class="math inline">\(d_x(y)\)</span></strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D_x(y) = \min_v\{c(x, y) + D_v(y)\}, \text{ for each node } y \in N\]</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Iterative, Asynchronous</strong>: Local iterations are caused by.
<ul>
<li>Local link cost change.</li>
<li>Distance vector update message from neighbour.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Distributed</strong>: Each node notifies neighbours <em>only</em> when its distance vector changes.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wj4TIZx.png" /></p>
<h4 id="distance-vector-problems">Distance Vector Problems</h4>
<p>When <strong>link cost</strong> changes, the node needs to update routing information, and recalculate the distance vector. If the distance vector changes, it must notify neighbours.</p>
<p><strong>Bad news travels slow</strong>. There can be a routing loop between two nodes if a cost update reverses the minimum cost path. In order to broadcast the distance vector to its neighbours, nodes will keep passing information back to each other and updating distance vectors. <strong>Counting to infinity problem</strong>.</p>
<p>We used <strong>poisoned reverse</strong> in order to solve the problem of routing loops. If <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> routes through <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> to get to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> tells <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(D_y(x) = \infty\)</span>. This does not completely solve the problem, we need to poison every node from source to destination.</p>
