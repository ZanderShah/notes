<p><strong>Diane Warren</strong> (1956-) <em>Songwriter</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Most successful in Western pop .</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="north-american-pop">North American Pop</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>1945 (End of WWII 1939-1945)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>End of the “Big Band” era which dominated since the mid 1930s (trumpets, saxophone, trombone)</p>
<ul>
<li>Primarily intended for dancing.</li>
<li>Lack of focus on vocal</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of Big Band Music: 1944 “Sentimental Journey” (Brown / Homer / Green)</p>
<ul>
<li>Performed by Les Brown and his Band of Renown, ft. Doris Day
<ul>
<li>Doris Day will become a film / music star in the 1950s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Song title evokes sentiments from WWI</li>
<li>Singers were just a part of the band.</li>
<li>Since 1950s, there is an emphasis on vocals but this was not always the case.</li>
<li>Smooth and vocalized voice, you can hear the words clearly; control and calm</li>
<li>Band leaders are “the stars”. Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey.</li>
<li>Music industry divided into 3 categores:
<ol type="1">
<li>Pop: White, middle class, urban / northern US (where the money is).</li>
<li>Race (Blues): Black, regardless of class or location.</li>
<li>Hillbilly (Country): Lower / working class, primarily white / southern US.
<ul>
<li>Origins in poor, rural part of southern US but is migrating to urban areas (particularily in the south).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Example of Race Music: “Good Rockin’ Tonight” (Roy Brown 1947)</p>
<ul>
<li>Performed by Wynonie Harris in 1948.</li>
<li>Specifically Jump Blues.</li>
<li>A lot of the same instruments seem as the big bands but smaller (trumpets, saxophone, bass).</li>
<li>Rougher / grunge / aggressive voice, harder to understand, chest sound; due to different intended audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of Hillbilly Music: “Blue Moon of Kentucky” (Bill Monroe 1946, recorded/released in 1947)</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically Blue Grass.</li>
<li>Different instruments: guitar, fiddle, mandelin.</li>
<li>Controlled but forward nasal sound.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>products</strong> of the music insdustry at this time are sheet music and recordings. Sheet music dominates recordings until the late 1920s. By the end of WWII, recording industry has come to dominate.</p>
<h2 id="why-a-music-industry-development-of-american-music-industry">Why a Music Industry? Development of American Music Industry</h2>
<ul>
<li>1600s, you could steal pamphlets and make copies yourself to sell because there was no intellectual property.</li>
<li>People complained to the Queen so you can now get sole rights to make copies and distribute to make money from an idea (copyright).</li>
<li>You would get payments from the stationers company (Queen) when people used your work (royalties).</li>
</ul>
<p>We need copyright law - intellectual property.</p>
<ul>
<li>1790s-1830s, Ammendments to the copyright laws to cover sheet music.</li>
<li>The Victorial Ballad: (Queen Victoria).
<ul>
<li>appearance and social mobility is everything</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Industrial Revolusion made it so that there was now a middle class. The new middle class wanted to show off their money. Ways to do this are to buy luxury items (piano) and have daughters pursue “leisure” activities and women in the family does not have to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rise of middle class to have <em>Parlour Songs</em> written specifically for middle class</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parlour Songs</strong></p>
<p>Example of Parlour Song: “Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms” (Thomas Moore, early 1800s)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Themes: Loyalty, honesty, control, restraint (idealized romance).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>AABA</li>
<li>Piano accompaniment, showcase vocal control.</li>
<li>Target young women about idealized love</li>
<li>Daughters would move up the social ladder by marrying.</li>
<li>Control / restraint style originates from Victorian age.</li>
</ul>
<p>Demand for newly composed songs led to an increased organization of the music industry. Music writers did not make a lot of money at this point.</p>
<h2 id="tin-pan-alley">Tin Pan Alley</h2>
<p>Parlour song: “After the Ball” (Charles K Harris 1892)</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical song but became very popular, first sheet music sold over 5 mil copies (usually less than 100k).</li>
<li>Music industry’s first “hit song”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why 1892?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rural to urban shift.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There cannot be a hit song if everyone lives in rural areas because it is too hard to spread the song. In the US, many people are migrating to the urban areas at this point in time (by the 1890s, over <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> lives in cities).</p>
<p>Now everyone knows you can get rich from the music industry, most of them go to New York City in a place known as Tin Pan Alley (Manhattan), the centre of professional music making.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One story is that everyones piano was overlapping each other and it sounded like people were banging on tin pans</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>At it’s peak in the 1920s, 1930s, 21000 publishers, 36000 composers.</li>
<li>Develops an efficient way of creating music, <strong>divisions of labour</strong> (composer, lyricist, publisher, publicity, performers). Allows for quality control and efficiency.</li>
<li>Lyric style is still the same as before, idealized romance.</li>
<li>Music is made to be easy to play / sing. AABA musical form (upper case for melody) - verse verse bridge verse.
<ul>
<li>Specifies the melody.</li>
<li>Easy to play, easy to sing with simple phrasing and range</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” (Arlen / Harburg 1939)</p>
<p>There was no focus on singer at this time, more on songs. Popular songs were not linked to an artist. There is also no distinction based on age (e.g. people of all ages would like big bands).</p>
<h1 id="north-american-slave-trade">North American Slave Trade</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>(1619 - (1863) 1865) Music culture was brought over through slavery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: “Work Song - Old Alabama” 1947</p>
<ul>
<li>There were no recordings of slave work songs, this one is a prison work song.</li>
<li>For efficiency and entertainment</li>
<li>Used to pass time / set pace / coordinate work.</li>
<li><strong>Song Leader</strong>: “Floating pool of verses”; Worked with many small pieces of songs and put them together in real time.
<ul>
<li>Two lines, guess which one it will be. More interactive than just repeating the same song.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="folk-music">Folk Music</h2>
<ul>
<li>Performed by amateurs.</li>
<li>Self or community entertainment.</li>
<li>Passed by oral tradition.</li>
<li>More concern with tradition than innovation (lacking <em>self-consciousness</em>).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>So much energy that you are drained and spent after a performance</li>
<li>Values in the intensity of effort in African culture</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use of <strong>Riffs</strong>: Small self-contained musical gesture that repeats, becoming the basis for a longer composition.</li>
<li>Use of <em>call and response</em>.
<ul>
<li>Energy flow.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Institutionalized racism.</li>
<li>Acceleration of rural-to-urban shift.</li>
<li>New form of music appears during the late 1800s.</li>
<li>Ragtime and Jazz.
<ul>
<li>Urban styles, incorporated into popular music.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Centers close to the Mississippi river.</li>

<h2 id="country-rural-blues">Country (Rural) Blues</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Blues is a broad term.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wandering musicians.</li>
<li>Male vocalist, with acoustic guitar.
<ul>
<li>Too dangerous for women at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Plaintive vocal sound (lament).</li>
<li>Themes include: travel, economics, love.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="musical-form">Musical Form</h3>
<ul>
<li>12 measure phrases. No other styles specified length.</li>
<li>a-a-b lyric pattern.</li>
<li>Call and response between guitar and voice.</li>
<li>Early Blues performers made use of <em>floating pool of verse</em> (not formally writing out song).</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Travellin’ Blues” (Blind Willie McTell 1929)</p>
<ul>
<li>First blues recording in the 1920s.</li>
<li>Closer to folk music because lacks <em>self-awareness</em>.
<ul>
<li>Uneven bar counts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Sweet Home Chicago” (Robert Johnson November 1936)</p>
<ul>
<li>Defined standards for blues guitar.</li>
<li>Only made two sets of recordings (November 1936 / June 1937).</li>
<li>Standardized performance, very different from Blind Willie McTell.</li>
<li>First steps of African American Culture being a major influence.</li>
<li>Self consciousness, thought out song.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-in-technology">Changes In Technology</h2>
<h3 id="mechanical-reproduction">Mechanical Reproduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>1877, Edison invents the phonograph (granophone).
<ul>
<li>Wax, not reusable, had business intentions / political but not music.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1895-1912, transition from wax cylinder to disks.</li>
<li>1925, industry standard set to 78 rpm, It was a balance betwen quality and playback time.</li>
<li>One of the biggest hurdles was to convince people to buy records.</li>
<li>In 1925, recording industry starts to rise to prominence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-was-recorded">What Was Recorded?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sheet music (TPA), still controlled by the same people.</li>
<li>Black / Rural Southern White music was not recorded because TPA did not care.
<ul>
<li>They only cared about what they thought they could sell.</li>
<li>Harder to sell to rural areas due to distance and populations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="commercial-radio">Commercial Radio</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>1920, recording industry almost dies.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jan 1922, 28 sations. Dec 1922, 570 stations.</li>
<li>Controlled by only a few “Networks” (CBS, NBC, Mutual).
<ul>
<li>NBC was the first (1928).</li>
<li>Networks would buy up local networks and hook them up with telephone lines.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial radio changed how a song would become popular and how fast a song would become popular. A song can become a hit over the nation at the same time.</p>
<p>Black music was not played on the radio, so it maintained regional differences.</p>
<h3 id="success-of-radio">Success of Radio</h3>
<ul>
<li>One time purchase, unlimited content.</li>
<li>Why buy records?</li>
<li>Non-musical entertainment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rise-of-the-record-industry">Rise of the Record Industry</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ralph Peer</strong>: worked for Okeh Records (Artists &amp; Repetoire).
<ul>
<li>Finds good musicians and songs for them to record.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Mamie Smith “Crazy Blues” (1920)</p>
<ul>
<li>Black vocalist.</li>
<li>Record sold relatively well, they did not expect African-Americans to own record players or for white middle class to be interested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ralph has an idea, radio has the exact same TPA music, there was a market to record African-American and rural white southern.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-of-hillbilly">Introduction of “Hillbilly”</h2>
<p>Example: Uncle Dave Macon and the Fruit Jar Drinkers “Carve that Possum” (1927)</p>
<ul>
<li>Banjo, acoustic guitar, mandelin, fiddle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-to-race">Introduction to “Race”</h2>
<p>Example: Carr and Blackwell “How Long Blues” (1928)</p>
<ul>
<li>Piano was added because it was performed in the city as opposed to rural area</li>
<li>Next step in the development of blues (city blues).</li>
<li>Increased complexity due to multiple musicians.</li>
<li>First “stars” around African-American audiences.</li>
<li>Earlier style (country blues) was recorded after newer (city blues).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometime in the 1930s, the recording industry overtakes sheet music and mainly goes back to playing popular music (TPA).</p>
<h2 id="television">Television</h2>
<ul>
<li>First demonstrated in 1927.</li>
<li>Experimental and low resolution broadcasts in 1930s.</li>
<li>Network broadcasts begin in 1939.</li>
<li>1945, 6 stations. 1955, 411 stations.</li>
<li>Major networks move to television and sell off radio, the radio networks are now mostly locally owned and have to come up with their own content, so they start to play records.
<ul>
<li>It was previously bad taste to play recordings over the radio.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>WDIA Memphis was the first “Black Appeal” radio station in 1948. By 1954, there are over 200 on the air.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Tin Pan Alley is in its dying days. The songs were very “safe”. Focus starts to fall of of the songs and towards the singers.</p>
<p>Examples: Nat King Cole “Too Young” (1951, Lippman / Dee), Patti Page “How Much Is That Doggie In The Window” (1952, Merril)</p>
<ul>
<li>World was emerging from WWII.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="baby-boomers">Baby Boomers</h3>
<p>Baby boomers are experiencing extended adolescence. They invent the teenager. Teenagers get to stay in school, have part time jobs, and spend the money from their part time jobs. A generation gap appears between the culture of parents and their children.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitor radio: portable and small.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="race-music">Race Music</h2>
<h3 id="jump-blues">Jump Blues</h3>
<p>We saw an example of Jump Blues before (“Good Rockin’ Tonight” 1948). This genre develops from a fusion of Big Band music (TPA / Jazz) with more the prominent blues / race music influence.</p>
<h3 id="gospel">Gospel</h3>
<p>Example: Ray Charles (1930-2004) “I’ve Got A Woman” (1954)</p>
<ul>
<li>Albany Georgia, blind at 7. Learns music at a school for the blind.</li>
<li>1952, Atlantic Records.</li>
<li>Fusion of the energy of African American spiritual practice with secular lyrics.</li>
<li>Success with white audiences.</li>
<li>Could learn to play almost anything (photographic memory of music).</li>
<li>Sacred music is called spirituals before the end of slavery and gospel afterwards.</li>
<li>Based on a song called “It Must Be Jesus”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chicago-electric-blues">Chicago Electric Blues</h3>
<p>Example: Muddy Waters (1913 - 1983) “Hoochie Coochie Man” (1954, Wille Dixon)</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in Mississippi. Played guitar and harmonica. Emulated Robert Johnson.</li>
<li>Moves to chicago in the early 1940s, switches to electric guitar in 1945.</li>
<li>1944, records for Aristocrat Records (Chess Records).</li>
<li>Verse Chorus structure (modified 12-bar blues).
<ul>
<li><strong>Chorus</strong>: Same music, same words, may include title of song, may feature a higher level of intensity.</li>
<li><strong>Verse</strong>: Same music, different words.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prominence of the electric guitar and harmonica.</li>
<li>Used the amplifier to <strong>distort</strong> the sound of the guitar.</li>
<li>Stop Time, sign of a practiced musician.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mid 1950s, WWII has changed everything. USA was able to build massive industry and experiences economic prosperity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended adolescence (baby boomers).</li>
<li>Rhythm and Blues become crossover hits (black appeal chart to pop chart).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cover-verions-1954---1956">Cover Verions: 1954 - 1956</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“White” versions of “black” songs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Combats the “moral panic” among white parents because white teenagers are listening to African American music and paying attention to their culture.</li>
<li>Several versions of the same song would end up on the charts at the same time.</li>
<li>The cover versions would have higher recording quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Little Richard (Richard Wayne Penniman)</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in 1932, Macon Georgia.</li>
<li>First big hit was “Tutti Frutti”.</li>
<li>Released late 1955 on Specialty Records (lyrics revised by Dorothy LaBostrie).</li>
<li>“Crossover” hit: #2 R&amp;B, #17 Pop.</li>
<li>Verse-chorus structure but each section is based on 12-bar blues.</li>
<li>Pat Boone cover song in early 1956: #10 Pop.
<ul>
<li>Just breaking as a pop star in 1955.</li>
<li>Echo sound, no distortion, band plays more restrained.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Sh-Boom” (The Chords / The Crew Cuts)</p>
<ul>
<li>Do-wop (singers take the place of instruments). Nonsense syllables.</li>
<li>Originally released by The Chords in 1954 on an independent label Cat Records.
<ul>
<li>#3 R&amp;B, #5 Pop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Covered by a Canadian group The Crew Cuts in 1954 by a major record Mercury Records.
<ul>
<li>Different musical structure (repeats the AABA twice).</li>
<li>Voice sounds a lot further, similar to the cover of “Tutti Frutti”. Echo and breathing.</li>
<li>No distortion in voice, no use of lower octave in the B part.</li>
<li>Timpani funny sound instead of sexy sax solo.</li>
<li>#1 Pop for 9 weeks, #1 song of the year.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact same type of covers were happening with country and western music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this racist? Or a continuation of TPA traditions?</p>
<p>By 1956, race covers lessen because a new type of pop emerges which does not fit into any old genre. A mixture of pop, C&amp;W, R&amp;B, target at teenagers: <strong>Rock ‘n’ Roll</strong>.</p>
<p>Bill Haley and the Comets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Born in 1925.</li>
<li>Originally “Bill Haley and the Saddlemen”, (part of C&amp;W: Western Swing).</li>
<li>Changes to “Bill Haley and the Comets” in 1952.</li>
<li>Early hits with “Crazy Man, Crazy”, and “Shake, Rattle and Roll”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Rock Around the Clock” (1954)</p>
<ul>
<li>Popular in 1955 movie “Blackboard Jungle” about R&amp;B causing juveniles delinquents.</li>
<li>12-bar blues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Baby Boomers liked to listen to music performed by similar age group. Bill Haley was in his 30s.</p>
<h1 id="elvis-presley-1935-1977">Elvis Presley (1935-1977)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Tupelo, Mississippi.</li>
<li>Exposed to all different types of music.</li>
<li>1953, 18 years old, Sam Phillips / Sun Records.</li>
<li>Spring 1954, starts recording with Scotty Moore (Guitar), Bill Black (Bass).</li>
<li>Dewey Phillips plays the song over 20 times in a row.</li>
<li>The next day, Elvis goes down to the radio station to be interviewed. “Which highschool did you go to?”, can tell everyone that he is white.</li>
</ul>
<p>July 1954 “That’s Alright Mamma” / “Blue Moon of Kentucky”</p>
<ul>
<li>“That’s a pop song now, little guy”, changes basic subdivision of “Blue Moon of Kentucky” from 3 to 4.</li>
<li>Percussive timbre.</li>
<li>1954 - 1955: Elvis with Sun slowly becomes a regional star, with some national success on Country Charts.</li>
<li>Before Rock ‘n’ Roll, they call his song Rockabilly, he had a nickname “The Hillbilly Cat”.</li>
<li>12 songs, all covers. He does not write songs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam Phillips sells Elvis’s record contract to RCA in 1956 for $35,000 (high for the standards of the time). He uses this money to promote more new artists, most notably, Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>11 appearances on national television (there are 3 channels in 1956). Tens of millions people watching. Everyone knows who he is.</p>
<p>Example: “Heartbreak Hotel” (April-May 1956)</p>
<ul>
<li>#1 Pop, #1 Country, #5 R&amp;B.</li>
</ul>
<p>August to December 1956, Elvis has #1 on pop charts. “Hound Dog”, “Don’t Be Cruel”, “Love Me Tender”. “Hound Dog” and “Don’t be Cruel” chart on #1 on Pop, Country, and R&amp;B.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Leave the guitar off stage”. Teenage girls going crazy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that one of the main characteristics of parlour music is control.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parker directs Elvis’ career towards more “Pop-friendly” material.</li>
<li>Elvis not charting on R&amp;B after 1957.</li>
<li>Elvis enters the army from March 1958 to March 1960. Develops an addition to perscription drugs. March 1961, last public performance for 7 years and just does movies.</li>
<li>the ’68 “Comeback Special”.</li>

<h1 id="chuck-berry">Chuck Berry</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In many ways, he is the complete opposite of Elvis.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Born in St. Louis (midwest), middle class.</li>
<li>Father was a carpenter.
<ul>
<li>Chuck look at records to see which African American artists were popular with middle class white (e.g. Nat King Cole). Notices that Nat King Cole has a very clear voice and tells stories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Very deliberate in what he wanted to do.
<ul>
<li>Decided that he wanted to be rich at a young age. Money guided many of his decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Talent competitions were very popular in African American culture. Chuck enters them and is looking for a way to stand out. He deliberately changes the tone of his guitar to be more similar to country / western and sings with more of a nasal sound.</p>
<ul>
<li>1955, ends up at Chess Records after visiting many other recording companies. Chuck plays around with Ida Red during spare time in the same way that Elvis played around with blues.</li>
<li>Chess Records tells him to rewrite it again so that they do not have to pay the songwriter. He writes a story about an unfaithful woman but recasts it as a car chase to be more family friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Maybellene” (July 1955)</p>
<p>Chuck recognizes early on that he is targetting a brand new demographic of youth. He starts to write songs that he knows will appeal to teenagers (young white audience). Themes include cars (represents freedom and privacy), girls, no school, Rock ‘n’ Roll (celebrating the music itself).</p>
<ul>
<li>Very few “cover versions” of Berry’s songs because his songs aren’t perceived as threatening. There is nothing that they can do to his songs.
<ul>
<li>The centrality of the electric guitar made it hard to remove.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Johnny B. Goode” (1958)</p>
<ul>
<li>#2 R&amp;B, #8 Pop.</li>
<li>12-bar blues with a “text heavy” narrative.</li>
<li>White Elements.
<ul>
<li>“Down Louisiana across to New Orleans”</li>
<li>“Text heavy” narrative.</li>
<li>Clear enunciation.</li>
<li>Country guitar sound.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Black Elements.
<ul>
<li>Blues chord structure.</li>
<li>Added 6th (boogie woogie).
<ul>
<li>Piano would play busy bass line with left and and solo with right hand.</li>
<li>Guitar players would simplify the bass line.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Call and response between voice and guitar.</li>
<li>Guitar solo is structured on timbre, rhythm, articulation.
<ul>
<li>You can play the same note on different strings to change timbre.</li>
<li>You can change articulation by pressing the string differently or sliding to a note.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Elvis was a guitar <em>owner</em>, Chuck was a guitar <em>player</em>.</p>

<p>A whole generation of bands will model themselves after Chuck Berry. He played the electric guitar and wrote his own songs.</p>
<p>“If you wanted to give rock and roll a different name, you would call it Chuck Berry” - <strong>John Lennon</strong>.</p>
<p>This period is referred to historically as the <strong>Golden Age of Rock and Roll</strong> (1954 - 1959).</p>
<p>Elvis worked in the major recording companies because he did not write his own songs and therefore fit the division of labour.</p>
<h2 id="corruption---payola">Corruption - Payola</h2>
<ul>
<li>Major recording companies linked race with the “quality” of the music.</li>
<li>They spread rumors that the DJs were getting bribed in order to play them.</li>
<li>Rock ‘n’ Roll is attacked on the grounds that it is inferior music.</li>
<li>Payola Hearings (bribery). Turns out that everyone in the music industry was taking bribes.</li>
<li>Alan Freed (the man who coins the term <em>Rock ‘n’ Roll</em>).
<ul>
<li>Fired from his job, gets hounded to death.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bribery and corruption were nothing new.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major records had a good reason to be scared of Rock n Roll. In 1954, the music industry is estimated at <strong>$200m</strong>. By the end of 1959, it is estimated <strong>$600m</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pop top 10 was 15% Rock n Roll in 1955, 42% in 1959. The independent record companies accounted for about 21%, 66% in 1959.</p>
<p><strong>Racism</strong>: Reaction against the perceived integration of youth. Birth of Rock and Roll coincides with emergence of Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Court Case</strong>: May 1954. Brown vs. The Board of Education. The Supreme Court ordered the educational systems to end segregation.</li>
<li>Rosa Parks, Montgomery Alabama. Was illegal for African Americans to sit at the front of the bus. Montgomery Bus Boycott.
<ul>
<li>Story attracted international attention. Town was so embarassed, by the end of 1956, they take down the signs that divide the bus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Freedom Riders. Was illegal for people of opposite race to sit beside each other as they crossed the state lines.</li>
<li>Lunch Counter Sit-ins. Would go to lunch counters that do not serve African Americans and just sit there.</li>

<h1 id="the-in-between-years-1959---1963">The “In-Between” Years (1959 - 1963)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The end of the “Golden Age” of Rock and Roll, to the arrival of the Beatles (February 1964).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Major labels recognize that Rock and Roll is not a fad and begin to produce music similar to Rock and Roll, aimed at teenagers of the late 1950s / early 1960s. The only difference was that they were produced with the <em>divsion of labour</em> system.</p>
<h2 id="dance-craze">Dance Craze</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Starts by a song that came out of rythm and blues. “The Twist”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that a song that describes a dance becomes popular. Large music industries start to pump out songs about dances.</p>
<p>Example: “The Locomotion” Little Eva (1962, Goffin, King)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Little Eva was the babysitter for Goffin’s and King’s children.</p></li>
<li><strong>Teel idols</strong>. Clean-cut, idealized boyfriend. No “bad boy” image from the Golden Age.
<ul>
<li>Singing was almost secondary to looks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Blue Velvet” Bobby Vinton (1963)</p>
<ul>
<li>Composed in 1950, was a major hit for Tony Bennett in 1951.</li>
<li>Smoother sounding, but there are instruments you would have not heard 10 years older.
<ul>
<li>Electric guitar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Older TPA songs could be reworked in the new style.</li>
<li>Newer songs are written specifically for the new teen demographic. Romantic (non-sexualized) love, and dancing.</li>
<li>Most of the newer singers did not write songs. These songs were coming from professional songwriters (not technically called TPA, but still in NYC).
<ul>
<li>The Brill Building.</li>
<li>Don Kirshaner / Alvin Nevins, Aldon Music. They employed some of the most successful songwriters of the time.</li>
<li>Worked largely in pairs, lyricists and composers.</li>
<li>Song could go from not written to a major hit in less than 3 weeks. Looking at the charts, you will see many different artists, but the same songwriters (most of them were the Brill Building songwriters).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize the “In-Between Years”, division of labour figures out how to create songs that teenagers will buy and parent will not be scared of.</p>
<h2 id="rise-of-the-producer">Rise of the Producer</h2>

<li>More reliable than records which could scratch or skip.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bing Crosby becomes the first celebrity to pre-record a weekly broadcast.</li>
<li>1948, Bing gives one of the first commercially produced reel-to-reel tape recorders to Les Paul.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="les-paul-1915---2009">Les Paul (1915 - 2009)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Popularizes the solid-body electric guitar.</li>
<li>Wishes to create recordings by layering performances.</li>
<li>Assists in the development of the “multitrack” tape recording.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: “Sitting On Top Of The World” (Les Paul with Mary Ford, 1953)</p>
<p><strong>Multitrack recording redefines the process of recording. Reproduction to Production.</strong> Creating a moment that never actually happened. During the In-Between Years, the recording industry begins the transition from recording complete songs in a single “take” to the use of multitrack recording.</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazing musicians, unrivaled background vocal complexity.</li>
<li>Brian Wilson was the creative force (<em>brains</em>).
<ul>
<li>Songwriter, arrangement, recording engineer, producer. Was allowed to produce the Beach Boy’s records himself.</li>
<li>The one person in the world who scared the Beatles.</li>
<li>Suspected to be schizophrenia, tried to combat with drugs and alcohol.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Beach Boys decline in popularity through the late 1960s because of Brian Wilson’s mental illness and changes in approaching popular music that they cannot keep up with.</p>
<h2 id="folk-revival">Folk Revival</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many of the teen fans during the golden age of Rock ‘n’ Roll are now in their early 20s.</li>
<li>Now in University, many are looking for music that is more “serious”.
<ul>
<li>Folk music tells stories about issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sounds similar to Folk music that we studied before, except that these are professional musicians.</li>
<li><strong>Authentic</strong> because it is not surrounded by money (at least on the surface).
<ul>
<li>Attention was not called to the music industry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heavily involved in politics (<em>left</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Woody Guthrie</strong>: “This machine kills fascists”.</p>
<p>Example: “This Land Is Your Land” (Woody Guthrie, 1940)</p>
<ul>
<li>Performed by The Weavers: Pete Seeger.</li>
<li>Very good musicians, not flashy.</li>
<li>Try hard to not seem <strong>self-concious</strong>.</li>
<li>Lyric content about the political left.</li>
</ul>
<p>After WWII, Weavers are blacklisted on suspicion of communism. Communist witch hunt Paul McCarthy (MyCarthyism). Folk music almost disappears until the baby boomers.</p>
<p>The music industry creates a style of folk music, which is simlar to early music but more <em>produced</em>, smoother sounding, more <em>arranged</em>. Targetted to the leading age of baby boomers.</p>
<p>Example: “Tom Dooley” (The Kingston Trio, 1959)</p>
<p><strong>Bob Dylan</strong> (1961 - 1965): Traditional folk singer / songwriter. Leader in new generation of folk musicians.</p>
<p>Example: “A Hard Rain’s A Gonna Fall” (Bob Dylan, 1963)</p>
<ul>
<li>Started in 1962, finished in 1963.</li>
<li>Timelessness, many allegories.</li>
<li>Numeric references.</li>
<li>Cuban missile crisis, October 1962. US Navy surrounds Cuba.</li>
